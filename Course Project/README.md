# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Rider Counts

## Overview

This project focuses on the time series analysis and forecasting of rider counts using data from multiple years. The analysis includes data preprocessing, outlier handling, log transformation, and decomposition of the time series to understand trends and seasonality.

## Objectives

- **Data Loading and Combination**: Load and combine rider count datasets from different years into a single DataFrame for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, detect and handle outliers, and apply log transformation to stabilize variance.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Decompose the time series to identify and visualize trends, seasonality, and residual components.

## Achievements

1. **Data Loading and Combination**:
    - Successfully loaded datasets from 2020, 2021, and 2023.
    - Combined the datasets into a single DataFrame and ensured the date index was properly formatted and consistent.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Filled or interpolated missing values to ensure a continuous time series.
    - Handled outliers by capping values at the 95th percentile and replaced zeros with a small positive value.
    - Applied log transformation to stabilize the variance in the time series.

3. **Time Series Decomposition**:
    - Decomposed the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
    - Visualized the decomposed components to gain insights into the underlying patterns in rider counts.

## Why These Achievements Matter

- **Accurate Forecasting**: Preprocessing and transforming the data ensures that forecasting models can make accurate predictions based on historical trends.
- **Understanding Trends**: Decomposing the time series allows for a clear understanding of the long-term trends and seasonal variations, which are crucial for planning and decision-making in public transportation management.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors affecting rider counts, enabling data-driven decisions for optimizing resources and improving services.
