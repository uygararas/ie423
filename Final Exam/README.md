# Online Shoppers Intention Analysis

## Overview

This notgebook analyzes the **Online Shoppers Intention** dataset to predict whether a visitor will make a purchase. The analysis includes data exploration, feature engineering, and the application of multiple machine learning models to find the best predictor for customer purchasing behavior. This notebook is the Final Exam of the Course IE-423.

## Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and check for missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to capture more complex patterns in the data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers, and perform necessary transformations.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict purchase intentions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the relationships between features and their impact on purchase decisions.

## Achievements

1. **Data Exploration**:
    - Successfully loaded the dataset and explored feature distributions and summary statistics.
    - Identified missing values and correlations between features.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Created new features to improve the predictive power of the models.
    - Identified key features that significantly impact purchase intentions, such as `ProductRelated` page visits, `BounceRates`, `ExitRates`, and `PageValues`.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handled missing values and outliers to clean the dataset.
    - Applied transformations to enhance model performance.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - Trained various machine learning models and evaluated them using performance metrics.
    - Selected the best model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Correlation Analysis**:
    - Conducted a detailed correlation analysis to understand feature relationships.
    - Visualized correlations to identify key patterns influencing purchase decisions.
