# Predictive Analysis and Model Comparison for Bank Term Deposit Subscriptions

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on various demographic and transactional features. The task involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and comparison of different machine learning models.

## Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore and visualize the data to uncover relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Model Development**: Build and train multiple machine learning models to predict term deposit subscriptions.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using metrics like ROC-AUC and F1 score.

## Achievements

1. **Data Loading and Initialization**:
    - Successfully loaded the bank dataset and initialized necessary libraries for data processing and modeling.
    - Conducted initial checks for missing values and unique values in the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Performed one-hot encoding on categorical variables to convert them into numerical formats suitable for modeling.
    - Prepared the dataset for efficient model training and evaluation.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualized the distribution of key numerical features such as age, balance, and duration.
    - Used scatter plots and pair plots to explore relationships between features and the target variable.

4. **Model Development**:
    - Implemented several models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
    - Trained and evaluated the models using ROC-AUC, precision-recall curves, and F1 scores.

5. **Model Comparison**:
    - Compared the performance of different models to identify the best approach for predicting term deposit subscriptions.
    - Visualized ROC and precision-recall curves to understand the trade-offs between model choices.

## Why These Achievements Matter

- **Data Preprocessing**: Properly preparing the data ensured that the models could accurately interpret and predict customer behavior.
- **Model Comparison**: Comparing multiple models provided insights into the most effective approach for this predictive task, ensuring robust and accurate predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using ROC-AUC and F1 scores allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of model performance, helping to select the most reliable model.
