# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering on Black Friday Data

## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on the Black Friday dataset. The task involves data preprocessing, clustering, and analysis of the resulting customer segments to understand different profiles based on demographic and purchasing behavior.

## Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Impute missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical formats, and scale the data for clustering.
- **Clustering with K-Means**: Segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and demographics.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of key variables across clusters and calculate the average purchase amount per cluster.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of demographic features and purchasing behavior across different customer segments.

## Achievements

1. **Data Loading and Initialization**:
    - Successfully loaded the Black Friday dataset and initialized necessary libraries for data processing and clustering.
    - Conducted initial data preprocessing to handle missing values and convert categorical variables.

2. **Clustering with K-Means**:
    - Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into 5 distinct clusters.
    - Assigned cluster labels to each customer for further analysis.

3. **Cluster Analysis**:
    - Analyzed the distribution of key variables such as gender, age, city category, and marital status across clusters.
    - Calculated the average purchase amount per cluster to understand the purchasing behavior within each segment.

4. **Visualization of Cluster Distributions**:
    - Visualized the distributions of demographic features and purchasing behavior across clusters using bar plots.
    - Identified which customer segments are the most profitable based on average purchase amount.

## Why These Achievements Matter

- **Customer Segmentation**: Understanding different customer segments allows for more effective targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyzing and visualizing the clusters provided clear insights into the key characteristics of each customer segment, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
- **Profitability Analysis**: Identifying the most profitable segments helps in allocating resources and efforts to maximize returns.
