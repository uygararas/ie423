# Exploring NLP Tasks with Transformers

## Overview

This project explores various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using pre-trained models from the `transformers` library. The tasks include text generation, sentiment analysis, question answering, summarization, and named entity recognition (NER).

## Objectives

- **Text Generation**: Generate coherent text sequences using the GPT-2 model.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify the sentiment of a given text using a BERT-based model.
- **Question Answering**: Implement a question-answering system using the DistilBERT model.
- **Text Summarization**: Condense longer text into concise summaries using a BART model.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify and categorize entities within text using a BERT-based NER model.

## Achievements

1. **Text Generation**:
    - Utilized GPT-2 to generate text based on a provided prompt.
    - Produced coherent and contextually relevant text sequences.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
    - Implemented a sentiment analysis pipeline using a BERT-based model.
    - Successfully classified the sentiment of text as positive or negative.

3. **Question Answering**:
    - Created a question-answering system with DistilBERT.
    - Extracted accurate answers from provided contexts based on specific questions.

4. **Text Summarization**:
    - Applied a summarization model to condense text into a concise summary.
    - Generated summaries that captured the main points effectively.

5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
    - Performed NER using a BERT-based model fine-tuned on CoNLL-2003.
    - Identified and categorized entities such as organizations, locations, and more within a text.

## Why These Achievements Matter

- **Versatility of Transformers**: Demonstrates the wide range of applications that transformer models can handle in NLP tasks.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Leverages pre-trained models to achieve high performance with minimal additional training.
- **Practical Applications**: These NLP tasks are foundational for many real-world applications, from content generation to automated customer service.
