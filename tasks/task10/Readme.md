# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Electricity Demand

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and forecasting of electricity demand using time series data. The analysis includes decomposition to identify trend, seasonality, and residual components, as well as forecasting using the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) model.

## Objectives

- **Time Series Decomposition**: Decompose the time series data to understand the underlying trend, seasonality, and residuals.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Ensure the continuity of the time series by filling or interpolating missing data.
- **Autocorrelation Analysis**: Analyze the autocorrelation of the time series to identify relationships between observations at different lags.
- **Stationarity Testing**: Perform stationarity tests to determine the stability of the time series data.
- **Forecasting**: Use the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) model to forecast future electricity demand.

## Achievements

1. **Data Loading and Initialization**:
    - Successfully loaded the electricity demand dataset and converted the datetime column for time series analysis.
    - Set the datetime column as the index for better handling of time series data.

2. **Time Series Decomposition**:
    - Decomposed the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components using both seasonal decomposition and STL decomposition.
    - Visualized the components to understand the underlying patterns in electricity demand.

3. **Handling Missing Data**:
    - Checked for missing data and interpolated missing values to ensure a continuous time series.
    - Repeated the decomposition after handling missing data to confirm patterns.

4. **Autocorrelation Analysis**:
    - Conducted autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis to identify relationships at different lags.
    - Used ACF and PACF plots to determine the presence of autocorrelation in the data.

5. **Stationarity Testing**:
    - Performed the Dickey-Fuller test to check the stationarity of the time series.
    - Analyzed the results to determine if the data was stationary.

6. **Forecasting Using ETS Model**:
    - Applied the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) model to forecast future electricity demand.
    - Fitted the model, generated forecasts, and visualized the results.

## Why These Achievements Matter

- **Understanding Patterns**: Decomposing the time series into components allowed for a clear understanding of the underlying patterns in electricity demand.
- **Accurate Forecasting**: By using the ETS model, the project provided accurate forecasts that can be used for planning and decision-making in energy management.
- **Data Integrity**: Handling missing data ensured that the time series analysis was based on a complete and reliable dataset.
