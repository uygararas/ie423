# Predicting Purchase Amount on Black Friday

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the purchase amount during Black Friday sales based on customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The task involves data preprocessing, model building using a Random Forest Regressor, and evaluation of the model’s performance.

## Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and convert categorical variables into numerical format for modeling.
- **Model Development**: Build and train a Random Forest Regressor to predict purchase amounts.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visualize feature importance.

## Achievements

1. **Data Loading and Initialization**:
    - Successfully loaded the Black Friday dataset and initialized the necessary libraries for processing and modeling.
    - Conducted initial data exploration to understand the dataset structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Addressed missing data and converted categorical variables into numerical formats.
    - Mapped age groups, city categories, and other features for better model interpretation.

3. **Model Development**:
    - Implemented a Random Forest Regressor to predict purchase amounts.
    - Used `train_test_split` to create training and testing sets, ensuring a robust model evaluation process.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to gauge prediction accuracy.
    - Visualized feature importance to determine which variables most influenced purchase predictions.

## Why These Achievements Matter

- **Data Preprocessing**: Proper data preprocessing ensured that the model could handle real-world data complexities, leading to more accurate predictions.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: The choice of this model allowed for capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between features, making it suitable for this task.
- **Evaluation and Feature Importance**: Using MAE provided a clear measure of the model’s predictive accuracy, while feature importance visualization helped in understanding the key drivers of purchase behavior.
