# Image Classification with CNN and DNN on Fashion MNIST

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using two different neural network architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The task involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation of both models to compare their performance.

## Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the Fashion MNIST dataset for input into neural networks by reshaping and normalizing the images and converting labels into categorical format.
- **Model Development - CNN**: Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify clothing items.
- **Model Development - DNN**: Build and train a Deep Neural Network to classify the same dataset and compare its performance to the CNN.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of both models using accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and training history visualizations.

## Achievements

1. **Data Loading and Initialization**:
    - Successfully loaded the Fashion MNIST dataset and initialized necessary libraries for processing and modeling.
    - Conducted initial data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for neural network training.

2. **Model Development - CNN**:
    - Built a Convolutional Neural Network with convolutional, max-pooling, and fully connected layers.
    - Trained the CNN model on the Fashion MNIST dataset and validated its performance on the test data.

3. **Model Evaluation - CNN**:
    - Evaluated the CNN model using classification metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
    - Visualized the accuracy of the CNN model over the training epochs to assess its learning progress.

4. **Model Development - DNN**:
    - Built a Deep Neural Network with fully connected layers and dropout for regularization.
    - Trained the DNN on the same dataset and compared its performance to the CNN.

5. **Model Evaluation - DNN**:
    - Evaluated the DNN model using similar metrics and visualized its training history for comparison with the CNN.

## Why These Achievements Matter
